# Mobile Button Click Fix Documentation

## Problem
Sign-out button and other buttons were not working on mobile devices due to:
1. Overly aggressive touch event prevention for pull-to-refresh
2. Insufficient z-index layering
3. Small touch targets on mobile

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Refined Touch Event Handling
- Modified touch event handlers to check if target is a button
- Added threshold (10px) before preventing pull-to-refresh
- Excluded buttons from preventDefault calls

```javascript
// Check if the touch target is a button or inside a button
const isButton = e.target.closest('button')
if (isButton) {
  // Don't prevent default on buttons
  return
}
```

### 2. CSS Button Improvements
- Added explicit z-index: 10 to all buttons
- Added z-index: 100 to header buttons specifically
- Added pointer-events: auto to ensure clickability
- Added touch-action: manipulation for better touch handling
- Removed tap highlight color for cleaner appearance

### 3. Touch Target Sizing
- Ensured minimum 44px touch target size (Apple HIG recommendation)
- Maintained adequate spacing between buttons
- Made buttons more prominent on mobile

### 4. Debugging
- Added console.log statements to track button clicks
- Helps verify if touch events are reaching handlers

## Testing
1. Test on actual mobile device (not just browser emulation)
2. Check sign-out button works consistently
3. Verify pull-to-refresh is still prevented
4. Ensure all navigation buttons are clickable
5. Test with different mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome)

## Key Changes
- App.jsx: Refined touch event handlers
- App.css: Enhanced button styles and z-index
- Added minimum touch target sizes
- Improved button accessibility on mobile
