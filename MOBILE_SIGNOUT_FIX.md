# Mobile Sign-Out Fix Documentation

## Problem
Sign-out button on mobile was not logging users out properly:
1. Button was clickable but sign-out wasn't completing
2. No visual feedback when sign-out failed
3. Touch events might have been interfering

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added result checking from signOut API call
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added user alerts for any errors
- Force page reload after successful sign-out to ensure complete logout

### 2. Touch Event Handling
- Added onTouchStart and onTouchEnd handlers
- Used stopPropagation to prevent event bubbling
- Added console logs to track touch events

### 3. CSS Improvements
- Added tap highlight color for visual feedback
- Prevented text selection on double tap
- Added iOS-specific cursor pointer support
- Ensured z-index and pointer-events are properly set

### 4. API Debugging
- Added console logs in signOut function
- Track current user state before clearing
- Log localStorage clearing

## Testing Instructions
1. Open browser console on mobile device
2. Try to sign out and watch for:
   - "Sign out button touched"
   - "Sign out button touch ended"  
   - "Sign out button clicked!"
   - "SignOut called, current user: [user object]"
   - "User cleared, localStorage cleared"
   - "Sign out result: {error: null}"
   - "Sign out successful"
3. Page should reload automatically after successful sign-out
4. If error occurs, alert will show with error message
