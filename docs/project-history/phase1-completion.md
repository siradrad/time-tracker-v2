# Phase 1 Completion: Project Cleanup & Reorganization

## Changes Made

### Documentation Reorganization
- Created a centralized `docs/` directory with the following structure:
  - `/project-history/`: Historical documents about project evolution
  - `/deployment/`: Deployment guides and instructions
  - `/supabase/`: Supabase setup documentation
  - `/testing/`: Testing procedures and checklists
  - `/design-mockups/`: Historical design mockups
- Moved documentation files from the root directory to appropriate subdirectories

### Design System Refinement
- Renamed `aesthetic-changes/` to `design-system/` for clarity
- Updated README.md in the design-system directory
- Created a symlink `aesthetic-changes-deprecated` for backward compatibility
- Added design-system CSS import to main.jsx

### Cleanup
- Removed unused files:
  - Deleted empty `apply diff V1` file
  - Removed `V1 Improvements Shotgun /Untitled.rtf` diff file
- Moved HTML mockup files to the docs directory
- Updated .gitignore with appropriate entries

## Validation

- Verified all documentation is properly organized
- Ensured the design system is correctly referenced and imported
- Maintained backward compatibility where necessary
- Cleaned up unused files to reduce clutter

## Next Steps

- Continue with Phase 2: Data Layer & Service Worker Refinement
- Specifically focus on renaming and refactoring `src/lib/supabase-real.js`
- Review and enhance caching in the DataService
- Plan for robust background sync in the service worker
